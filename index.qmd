Welcome to the PhylogeogRaphy workshop (with BEAST2)! 


Sessions are split into roughly two-hour chunks that align with typical start/end times of classes, and are meant to be as self-contained as possible -- so, feel free to come and go as necessary! All materials will posted here for you to catch up on content if desired.

Participants should bring their own laptops for hands-on exercises.  

For specific requirements, see the Requirements for workshop page.<br><br>
