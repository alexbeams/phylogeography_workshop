# BEAST2 analysis of example datasets:


## BSSVS on the server for analysis tomorrow

We will set up BEAST2 to carry out Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) to identify the most probable
migration pathways between geographic locations. How different will this analysis be from a basic discrete trait analysis, or
even a simple analysis that uses ace in R to estimate ancestral locations from trees sampled in step 1 above?


## Alternatively, you can choose a dataset (influenza H5N1, influenza H3N2, or MERS coronavirus) to analyze with MTBD models

## Size of datasets

influenza H5N1 and H3N2 are fairly small, and should be able to run on your laptop if you select a simple model. The MERS dataset is probably worth running on the remote server because of its size.

influenza H5N1: 43 sequences, 5 locations

influenza H3N2: 60 sequences, 2 locations

MERS: 274 sequences, 2 hosts (camels and humans)
